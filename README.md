# OpenAI-Responses-API-101
 Exploring OpenAI's Response API to build Agents and other tools

This repo accompanies "Open AI Responses API tutorials" courses in my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-HjK_9VqxUHNfjQfMgL1Z8vzLG3RFpJ0

The tutorials are designed to quickly teach the core concepts and features of Responses API, in 15 minutes or less per concept or tutorial. 

Responses API is the brand-new API released by Open AI in March of 2025, to build agentic applications (AI agents) and other AI programs. It is super simple and easy to learn compared to the previous API's!
